# Project Description

Implementing a chess game using the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. 

## Game Description

Chess is a two-player board game that is played on an 8x8 chessboard.India. It is a game for two players, one with the light pieces and one with the dark pieces. The game involves moving pieces across the board in an effort to capture the opponent's king. The player with the white pieces moves first and the players then take turns moving.The player who successfully captures the opponent's king wins the game.

### Queen Moves
The Queen can move in a straight line any number of squares in any one direction - horizontal, vertical, or diagonal as long as its path is not blocked by its own pieces. It can capture a piece of the opposite color in its path. Below, the black Queen can reach any of the highlighed squares shown in this diagram. It can capture the white Rook but its path is blocked in some directionsâ€“below by the black King and to the lower right by the black Knight.

## Requirements

1. Implement a chess game that can be played against the computer.
2. The computer will use the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make its moves.
3. The game should display the chessboard and pieces after each move.
4. The game should keep track of the moves made by both players.
5. The game should detect checkmate and declare the winner.
6. The game should detect stalemate and declare a draw.
7. The game should have a command line-based user interface to display the chessboard and pieces.
